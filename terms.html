                    <p>
                        USASecureLoans is not a lender and is responsible for any lending product advertised or offered to you.
                        All products or services advertised here or offered to you are the sole responsibility of their respective lenders or service providers.

                        You agree that clicking “Get Cash Now” (or other such button presented to you to submit your loan request) acts as your electronic signature.
                        You further consent that we and any lender we share your request with can communicate with you electronically and that any required disclosures may be provided to you electronically,
                        including without limitation any notices of adverse action that a lender might send to you.
                        You also confirm that you have the ability to access documents electronically, including the ability to view and save PDF files.
