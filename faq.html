                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#" name="link9">If I have an outstanding cash advance loan is it possible to get a new one?</a></strong>

                            <strong><a href="#" name="link10">When and how do I repay this loan?</a></strong>
                            <p>Both the loan fees and the amount is withdrawn directly from your checking account once the due date has been reached. You will not have to think twice about it!

                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#" name="link11">What happens if I'm late with repayment? </a></strong>
                            <p>There are different policies followed by different lenders in our network. It is advised that you review the policies pertaining to late payment often found in the lender's documentation prior to inserting your e-signature on that document. However, many states have laws that dictate how much lenders are allowed to charge for late payment. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#" name="link12">How is my private information to be protected?</a></strong>
                            <p>We use state of the art security systems. All your private information is kept securely in an encrypted format to ensure your security and privacy. More details can be found by reading our privacy policy.</p>

                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#" name="link13">When can I get another loan?</a></strong>
                            <p>Usually after 2 hours you can apply again. However, if you have already previously been approved for a loan then ensure that this info has been disclosed to the lender.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#" name="link14">Is an extension possible on repaying my loan? And how many extensions can I get?</a></strong>
                            <p>The state laws on this differ and dictate if a lender can grant you an extension often referred to as a 'rollover'. While some states allow for multiple rollovers, others do not allow it at all. You should ask your lender about anything concerning rollovers / extensions. Also make sure to contact your lender with an extension request prior to the due date of your payment. If you do not do it in time the lender will charge you additional fee and ask for immediate payment of the remaining balance. Also additional fees and other charges may be levied on you if you default.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#" name="link15">What happens if I'm not able to repay my loan?</a></strong>
                            <p>Lenders are always determined to pursue collections after the due date of their accounts to the fullest legal extent. You may have to face criminal charges and additional fees if you do not repay on time.</p>
                        </li>
