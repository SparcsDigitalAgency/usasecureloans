                    <p>USASecureLoans.com is not a lender - it does not make short term cash loans or credit decisions. USASecureLoans.com simply connects interested consumers with independent third party lenders. USASecureLoans.com’s loan matching services happen in real time, so you could be connected with an independent lender in seconds. Register online from home on your PC or from anywhere using your mobile device. The loan matching process begins the minute you submit your registration. If matched with a lender, you will be presented with a loan offer subject to that lender’s own terms and conditions. If you agree to those terms, the loan could be available for your use as early as the next business day.</p>
                    <p>Independent lenders have their own minimum requirements which must be met to be approved for a payday loan, and one independent lender’s may differ from another’s. Such minimum requirements typically include, but may not be limited to: </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>18 years of age or older</li>
                    <li>U.S. Citizenship</li>
                    <li>Valid checking or savings account with direct deposit </li>
                    <li>Regular income of at least $1,000 per month </li>
                    <li>Not a regular or reserve member of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard (or a dependent of someone who is), serving on active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or fewer </li>
